INTRODUCTION \\nStatistics and reports provide compelling evidence of the world becoming increasingly digital, with \\nmore transactions and activities taking place online. The growth in e -commerce, digital payments, digital \\ntransformation initiatives, internet and mobile usage, and cloud computin g adoption all underscore this \\ntrend. \\nIn 2023, global retail e-commerce sales were estimated at 5.8 trillion U.S. dollars (Statista, n.d.; Mouna \\n& Yassine, 2024). In the current year, they are projected to surpass 6.3 trillion U.S. dollars (van Gelder, \\n2024), with expectations for continued growth in the years ahead to surpass eight trillion dollars by 2027. \\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development reported that e -commerce's share of global retail \\nsales increased from 16% in 2019 to 19% in 2021, i ndicating a shift towards online shopping. World \\nPayments Report 2023 (Capgemini Research Institute, 2023) revealed that non -cash transactions have \\nremained robust as consumers and businesses, both small and large, embraced digital payment methods. \\nThe rep ort indicated that non -cash transaction volumes were expected to accelerate with a compound \\nannual growth rate of 15% from 2022 to 2027. This growth is driven by improving macroeconomic \\nconditions, the expansion of digital payment infrastructure, and the p roliferation of new payment \\ninstruments. Digital (non-cash) payment transactions are forecasted to reach 1.3 trillion by 2023, i.e., 16.6% \\nyear-over-year growth rate. Mobile payments, contactless cards, and digital wallets are driving this growth, \\nreflecting an increasing preference for online transactions.   \\nGartner reports that 91% of organizations are engaged in some form of digital initiative, with 87% of \\nsenior business leaders considering digitalization a company priority. The digital transformation m arket is \\nexpected to grow from $469.8 billion in 2020 to $1,009.8 billion by 2025. IDC (IDC, n.d.) predicts that \\nglobal spending on digital transformation will reach $3.9 trillion in 2027 with a five-year compound annual \\ngrowth rate of 16.1%. \\nIncrease in Internet and Mobile Device Usage is also a stable modern trend. ITU (ITU, n.d.) reports \\nthat by the end of 2023, 67% of the global population was using the Internet, up from 51% in 2019. The \\nnumber of mobile phone users reached 78 percent of the global population aged 10 and over in 2023. Next \\ndigitalisation trend is cloud computing adoption, for instance, according to Flexera 2023 State of the Cloud \\nReport (Flexera, 2024) 89% of enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy, and 73% have a hybrid cloud strategy, \\nindicating widespread adoption of cloud technologies. The shift to cloud computing supports the increasing \\ndigitalization of business operations and online activities. Gartner (Gartner, 2023) forecasts that global \\npublic cloud spending will grow on 20.4% t o total $678.8 billion in 2024 up from $563.6 billion in 2023.\"),\n",

Various reports, statistics, and expert analyses demonstrate cybercrime's \\nincreasing frequency and sophistication, including hacking, phishing, ransomware, and other malicious \\nactivities. These problems concern developed countries. For example, The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint \\nCenter reported that cybercrime resulted in $10.3 billion in losses in 2022, up from $6.9 billion in 2021. The \\nIC3 received 800,944 complaints in 2022, indi cating a steady increase in the number of incidents reported \\nyear over year. \\nThe Verizon Business published 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report (Verizon Business, 2024), \\nwhich highlights an increase during 2023 in ransomware attacks, accounting for 23% of all breaches analysed \\nand, 20% of users reported phishing in simulation exercises, and 11% of those who clicked the email also \\nreported it. \\nSophos State of Ransomware 2024 (Sophos Whitepaper, 2024) reports in 2023, 59% of organizations \\nwere targeted by ransomware, showing a slight yet welcome decrease from the 66% reported in each of the \\nprevious two years. Despite this reduction, with over half of organizations still facing attacks, it remains \\ncrucial to stay vigilant. As result all revenue segments saw a reduction in ransomware attack rates last year, \\nalthough the decrease for the $500M-$1B segment was less than one percentage point. However, even the \\nsmallest organizations, those with less than $10M in revenue, remain frequent target s, with just under half \\n(47%) experiencing ransomware attacks last year. Many attacks are carried out by sophisticated, well-funded \\ngroups, there is a rising trend of lower -skilled threat actors using crude, inexpensive ransomware. The \\naverage ransom deman ds differ significantly by industry, for instance, the IT, technology, and telecom \\nsectors reported the lowest median ransom payment at $300,000, followed by distribution and transport at \\n$440,000. On the higher end of the spectrum, both lower education and central/federal government sectors \\npaid median ransoms of $6.6 million. \\nCybercrime leads to significant financial losses. Businesses suffer from operational disruptions, \\nreputational damage, and direct financial theft. Worldwide according to (IBM, 2024),  in 2023 the average \\ncost of a data breach increased to USD 4.45 million, up by USD 100,000 from 2022. This marks a 2.3% rise \\nfrom the 2022 average cost of USD 4.35 million. Since 2020, when the average total cost was USD 3.86 \\nmillion, the overall average cost has risen by 15.3%. \\nAs mentioned in a recent Interpol report (Interpol, 2024), crime convergence often occurs around \\nfinancial fraud, with cybercrimes -as-a-service and money -laundering-as-a-service playing crucial roles in \\nenabling both individual fraudsters and criminal groups. \\nWith more personal information stored online, protecting this data from breaches is crucial for \\nmaintaining privacy and trust. For instance, the report 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report (Verizon \\nBusiness, 2023) found that 83% of data breaches involved sensitive personal information, highlighting the \\ncritical need for robust data protection measures to safeguard privacy and maintain trust among users and \\ncustomers. The proliferation of IoT devices introduces new vulnerabilit ies, as many of these devices have \\nweak security protocols, as an example can be mentioned Mirai Botnet incident in 2016 (CISA, 2016). The \\nMirai malware exploited weak security protocols in IoT devices, such as default usernames and passwords, \\nto create a massive botnet. This botnet was then used to launch a series of powerful Distributed Denial of \\nService attacks, including one that significantly disrupted major websites and online services like Twitter, \\nNetflix, and Reddit. The Mirai botnet highlighted th e security risks associated with poorly secured IoT \\ndevices and demonstrated how they could be leveraged to cause widespread disruption. \\nCyber-attacks on critical infrastructure (e.g. power grids, healthcare systems) can have devastating \\nconsequences for national security. For instance, evidence supporting this statement is the 2021 Colonial\"),\n",

This attack caused a major \\ndisruption in the fuel supply across the eastern United States, leading to widespread panic buying, fuel \\nshortages, and significant economic impacts. The incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical \\ninfrastructure to cyber-attacks and underscored the severe national security risks posed by such disruptions. \\nBoth cybercriminals and cybersecurity professionals have adopted AI and ML. Cybercriminals have \\nincreasingly adopted AI to create sophisticated malware that can evade traditional security measures. An \\nexample is malware that uses machine learning to modify its behaviour based on the environment it infects. \\nA notable case is the use of AI to develop polymorphic malware, which changes its code to avoid detection. \\nThis has been reported in various instances where malware adapts its behaviour to avoid signature -based \\ndetection systems and employs AI to identify vulnerabilities in targeted systems. On the defensive side, \\ncybersecurity professionals employ AI and ML to enhance threat detection and response capabilities. \\nMachine learning algorithms analyse vast amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies that could \\nindicate cyber threats. For example, the use of AI in Security Information and Event Management systems \\nhelps in real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. These systems \\nleverage machine learning to detect unusual patterns that might signify an ongoing attack, allowing for \\nquicker and more accurate responses (Sowmya & Mary Anita, 2023). \\nConsequently, governments are enacting stricter regulations to protect data, necessi tating robust \\ncybersecurity measures, for instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (Directive 95/46/EC, GDPR) \\nwas implemented in the European Union. Since its implementation in 2018, GDPR has imposed stringent \\nrequirements on data protection and privacy, leading to significant fines for non-compliance. For example, \\nin 2021, Amazon was fined a record €746 million ($888 million) for GDPR violations (Bodoni, 2021). This \\nenforcement highlights the increasing regulatory pressure on organizations to adopt  robust cybersecurity \\nmeasures to protect data and comply with strict privacy laws. \\nCybersecurity and cybercrime are crucial topics to investigate due to the widespread and evolving \\nnature of cyber threats, the growing dependency on digital systems, and the significant impacts on economic, \\npersonal, and national security. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing investment, education, and \\ncollaboration across all sectors of society. \\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \\nCybercrime poses multifaceted challenges to indivi duals, organizations, and societies, necessitating \\nconcerted efforts in research, policy, and technology to mitigate risks and enhance cybersecurity resilience. \\nScientific literature underscored the importance of continuous vigilance, collaboration, and in novation in \\naddressing evolving cyber threats and safeguarding digital ecosystems. \\nMuch research (Yamin & Murwaningsari, 2023; Ponomarenko et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; \\nIvashchenko & Polischuk, 2018; Chytilová et al., 2024; Anton, 2024; Pereira & Shafique, 2024; Musyaffi, \\n2024; Kliestik et al., 2023; Aliane et al., 2023; Krajčík et al ., 2023; Chang & Ku, 2023; Červinka, 2023; \\nAgboola et al., 2023; Odei Addo & Keelson, 2023; Lytvyn et al., 2024) was provided on the level of \\nenterprises and organisations. For example, the article (Yarovenko et al., 2021) aims to develop a rapid \\nmethodology for assessing the risk of information and knowledge loss management. It outlines an eight -\\nstep implementation process, utilizing a modified risk mapping method based on risk factors and incidents, \\nincorporating elements from set theory, and formalizing with binary estimates. The methodology considers \\nfive major events caused by company staff, technical problems, software issues, cybercriminals, and viral \\nattacks, as well as 66 factors influencing company incidents.

It considers various factors such as the number of Internet \\nusers, individ uals with advanced skills, and indicators related to infrastructure (e.g., network coverage, \\npopulation covered by 3G and 4G mobile networks), access (e.g., access to ICT at home, active mobile \\nbroadband subscriptions, fixed broadband subscriptions), enabl ers (e.g., fixed broadband exceeding 10 \\nMbps, mobile data and voice services, high consumption), and barriers (e.g., enhanced broadband access \\nfrom 256 kbps to 2 Mbps, from 2 Mbps to 10 Mbps mobile data and voice services, low consumption) of \\ndigital development. Other authors such as A.  Kigerl (2016), Bilan et al. (2023b) have published articles \\ndedicated to analysis of interdependences of internet connectivity of citizenships of different countries and \\ntheir technological development. As results in investigation (Kigerl, 2016) performing a K-means clustering \\nanalysis on a sample of 190 countries, considering seven dimensions of cybercrime, including malware, \\nfraud, spam, and digital piracy, along with measures of GDP and internet usage. The analysis revealed that \\ncountries could be categorized into four distinct groups based on their cybercrime activity: low cybercrime \\ncountries, non-serious cybercrime countries, advanced fee fraud countries, and phishing scam countries. \\nThe article (Yarovenko et al., 2023b ) analyses the socio -economic profiles of countries that fall victim to \\ncybercrimes resulting from malicious programs, viruses spread through email applications, and \\nvulnerabilities in information systems and computer networks. Cluster analysis confirms th at leading \\ncountries, such as the USA, China, Germany, and France, are both targets and initiators of cyberattacks. \\nThe analysis of country clusters based on associative rules strongly supports the notion that a country\\'s level \\nof socio-economic development can indirectly motivate cybercriminals to carry out mass cyberattacks. The \\nstudy (Yarovenko, 2020) aims to evaluate the threat level to countries\\' information security using a \\ncomprehensive index. It suggests employing five indicators that characterize specific aspects of information \\nsecurity, along with 37 indicators of global development selected from the World Bank database. The \\noutcome is illustrated on a map displaying countries categorized by their information security threat index, \\nthus creating five distinct groups. In developing nations, where addressing information threats significantly \\nimpacts the economy, the information security level is deemed \"acceptable.\" Countries with lower levels of \\ndevelopment and information security are classified lab elled as \"poor\" and \"very poor,\" indicating a \\nheightened threat level to their information security. The chapter of the book (Mokhtar & Rohaizat, 2024) \\naims to provide an overview of cybercrime and trends in combating it, the changes due to increasing internet \\nand computer connectivity, the rapid rise in internet user penetration during the COVID-19 pandemic, and \\nCyber Governance in both the ASEAN and EU regions.  \\nSeparate vector of research (Benghebrid & Sahnouni, 2023; Oe & Yamaoka, 2023; Konczos \\nSzombathelyi et al., 2023; Streimikiene et al., 2023; Fülöp et al., 2023; Androniceanu & Georgescu,  2023; \\nBenchea & Ilie, 2023; Kupenko et al., 2023) analyses the personal characteristics of cybersecurity.

The challenges linked with digital skills are considered by Bilan et al. (2023a), Jurek et \\nal. (2021), Straková et al. (2022). Similarly, the study (Nifakos et al., 2021) asserts that, alongside cyberattacks \\ntargeting vulnerabilities in information technology infrastructures, a novel form of cyberattack has emerged: \\nsocial engineering attacks, which seek to exploit human weaknesses. The study (Yarovenko et al., 2023a) \\naims to analyse IT users' behaviour regarding their pe rsonal protection against potential cybercrimes. The \\nresearch is based on survey data collected by the European Commission in 2020 -2021 from 35 European \\ncountries. Canonical analysis revealed that 66.67% of cybercrime cases (such as phishing, pharming, and  \\nonline identity theft) influence individuals' choices of personal protection methods (such as using a security \\ntoken, social media logins, and electronic identification). Kohonen's self -organizing maps were used to \\ncreate 9 clusters of countries based on IT users' attitudes toward personal cybersecurity. \\nMany studies (Benachour & Tarhlissia, 2024; Hrytsenko et al., 2024; Holtfort & Horsch, 2024; \\nShafranova et al., 2024; Niftiyev& Kheyirkhabarli, 2024; Filatova et al., 2023; Polishchuk, 2023; Shakatreh \\net al., 2023; Waliszewski et al., 2024; Piotrowski & Orzeszko, 2023; Hrytsenko et al., 2023; Alhanatleh et al., \\n2024; Vitvitskiy et al., 2021; Dewi et al., 2023; Minh Sang, 2024) are devoted to implementing digital \\ntechnologies in financial institutions and the risks associated with these processes. The article (Kuzior et al., \\n2022a) aims to forecast information trends related to the most prevalent cyberattacks, which are seen as \\nconsequences of cybercrimes reflected on the Internet. The authors developed addit ive and multiplicative \\ncyclical and trend-cyclical models with an exponential trend for predicting cyberattacks on computer systems \\nand cloud infrastructure. They also created a trend -cyclic additive model with a damped tendency for \\npredicting cyberattacks on network infrastructure. The findings suggest that the U.S. can expect cybercrimes \\ntargeting its financial system in the short and medium term, enabling the development of appropriate \\ncountermeasures for financial institutions to mitigate potential financial losses. The study (Yarovenko et al., \\n2023c) aims to formulate a scientific and methodological approach for modelling the potential behaviour of \\ninsider cyber fraudsters within banks. This approach involves a sophisticated combination of principal \\ncomponent analysis, k -means clustering, and associative analysis.

Research could  investigate how cyber threats \\nexacerbate existing inequalities and vulnerabilities, such as financial insecurity, lack of access to digital \\nresources, and limited cybersecurity awareness. Additionally, studies could explore the specific challenges \\nfaced by marginalized communities in responding to and recovering from cyberattacks, including financial \\nlosses, identity theft, and disruptions to essential services. Furthermore, there is a need to examine the \\neffectiveness of current cybersecurity strategies a nd policies in addressing the needs of vulnerable \\npopulations and developing regions. This could involve evaluating the accessibility and affordability of \\ncybersecurity tools and resources, as well as identifying gaps in support and assistance for affected  \\ncommunities. \\nThe current study aims to fill this void by conducting a cluster analysis of 33 countries globally. \\nThrough this analysis, each country will be assigned to a distinct typological category, differentiated from \\nnations of other types. This clas sification will be based on five cybercrime measures. Prior research has \\nestablished these variables to have a significant correlation with cybercrime. Thus, the purpose of this study \\nis to investigate the trends of changes in the level of crime in the digital space of the countries of the world \\nby means of their typology (clustering) depending on the values of the comprehensive indicator of the level \\nof cybercrime. \\n3. METHODOLOGY \\nThe main hypothesis of this study was that the rapid development and active  introduction of digital \\ntechnologies into all spheres of life in society negatively affect the level of crime in cyberspace and lead to \\nthe constant expansion of criminal activity schemes in digital space. At the first stage, an assessment of the \\nlevel of cybercrime of the country will be carried out. This indicator can be considered as an indicator that \\ncharacterizes the degree of protection of the country against cyberattacks on computer systems and \\nnetworks, cybercrime, unauthorized access to databases (the level of its cyber security). And therefore, its \\ncalculation allows us to assess the effectiveness of the state policy of ensuring cyber security. Countries with \\na high level of cybersecurity tend to be significantly less likely to be subject to or in itiate unauthorized \\nattacks. \\nThe calculation of the complex indicator is based on taking into account 5 indices characterizing the \\nlevel of cybercrime in the country: 1) The National Cyber Security Index (NCSI)  is a global index that \\ndetermines the efforts of countries in the direction of solving cyber threats and managing cyber incidents \\n(E-Governance Academy, 2024), the main of which are Denial of e -services – services are not accessible, \\nData integrity breach – unauthorized modification, Data confidenti ality breach – secrecy is exposed. In \\ngeneral, this index contains 49 indicators, within 3 categories and 12 capacities. 2) ICT Development Index \\n(ICTDI)– a composite indicator characterizing the level of development of the information and \\ncommunication technologies sector (ITUCOUNCIL Geneva, 2024); The use of this index allows us to take \\ninto account not only crime indicators directly, but also the degree of development and security of digital'),\n",

In addition, the calculation of this index is based on taking into account the level of digital  \\nliteracy of the population. When calculating, the values of this index will be taken into account as \\ndisincentives (from the point of view of the development of cybercrime). 3) Global Cybersecurity Index \\n(GCI) – an index, the use of which is aimed at incr easing awareness of cyber security in various industries \\nand sectors of the economy and measuring the commitment of countries to cyber security(European \\nCommission, 2024); 4) Global Terrorism Index (GTI) allows to assess the global trends of terrorism and \\ntakes into account a number of indicators of the development of terrorism in the country: the number of \\nincidences, fatalities, injuries and hostages (Institute for Economics and Peace, 2024). Given that cybercrime \\nincludes a number of types of illegal act ivities and given the lack of a single internationally accepted \\ndefinition of terrorism, taking into account the values of this index will allow us to approach this issue more \\ncomprehensively. Thus, the developers of the Global Terrorism Index define terrorism as the threatened or \\nactual use of illegal force to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal. These criteria for classifying \\na crime can also be applied to certain types of crimes in cyberspace. Thus, taking this index into account \\nwhen calculating a comprehensive indicator of cybercrime will allow us to take into account certain types \\nof terrorist activity carried out in cyberspace. 5) The Global Organized Crime Index (CI) an indicator that \\ndetermines the level of life safety in certain countries of the world (Numbeo Doo, 2024). This indicator is \\nbased on taking into account three components: the scope and impact of criminal markets, influence of \\ncriminal actors and capacity of resilience measures against organized crime. In block 2 \"Cri minal markets\" \\none of the components is cyber-dependent crimes, which will form the basis of our calculations. \\nThe data of the World Bank, the E-Governance Academy, the ITU Council Geneva, the Institute for \\nEconomics and Peace, the European Commission and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \\nDevelopment are the information base of the research. The object of the study is data from 33 countries, \\nthe study period is 2016-2023. The use of this number of countries allows to investigate cybercrime trends \\nfor countries with both high and low levels of digital development and the development of illegal activities \\nand to determine their interdependencies. \\nAt the first stage, based on a linear mathematical model, a complex indicator characterizing the level \\nof cybercrime in the country is calculated:  \\n𝑪𝑪𝑺𝑰 = ∑ 𝒘𝒊 × 𝑪𝑪𝑺𝑰𝒊𝒕\\n𝒏\\n𝒊=𝟏      (1) \\nwhere CCSI is a comprehensive indicator of the level of cybercrime, 𝑤𝑖 is a weighting coefficient of і-\\nindicator of a complex indicator characterizing the level of cybercrime in the country.

The number of clusters is determined using the \"Single Linkage\" technique. \\nThis met hod is based on cluster grouping, at each step, and consists in combining two clusters \\ncontaining the closest pair of elements: \\n \\n𝐷(𝑋, 𝑌) =  𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑥∈𝑋.𝑦∈𝑌𝑑(𝑥, 𝑦)     (3) \\n \\nwhere X and Y are any two sets of elements considered as clusters, d(x,y) is the distance between the \\ntwo elements x and y.'),\n",

This allows you to present data in the form of maps with preservation of the data structure, \\nin which neurons are located on a two-dimensional grid. \\nThe essence of the algorithm is that the vectors x of the input layer are compared with the vectors w \\nto find the nearest neuron according to the formula, which is the square of the Euclidean distance between \\nthe vector of bank indicators and the vector of weights of neuron j:  \\n𝑑(𝑥𝑖, 𝑤𝑗)  =  (𝑥𝑖 − 𝑤𝑗)′(𝑥𝑖 − 𝑤𝑗),  \\nwhere x = {xi: i = 1, … , n} is the n -dimensional set of bank variable vectors in the input layer; w = \\n{wj: j = 1, … , k} is a set of dimension k of vectors of weight coefficients of neurons in the output layer.  \\n \\nThen the input vectors begin to be introduced into the model iteratively. After the input data is fed to \\nthe model, the weights of the output layer are adjusted so that the wei ghts of the best matching unit are \\nclosest to the input vector, while the neighboring neurons are adjusted slightly less depending on their \\ndistances to the best matching unit. The further the neuron is from the best matching unit, the smaller its \\nadjustment. Thus, after many iterations, our original two-dimensional map acquires a topological structure. \\nWith the help of a heuristic algorithm of mapping a multidimensional array onto a two -dimensional \\nKohonen map, we get a result where homogeneous groups (clusters) are colored in the appropriate colors. \\nThe closer the position of the points on the map, the closer the value of the indicators, but taking into \\naccount all these values at the same time.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \\nThe results of calculating the level of cybercrime for 33 countries in 2016 -2023 (table 1) indicate a \\ngradual increase in the level of crime in cyberspace in the w orld.

The verification of this hypothesis was carried out using data from 33 countries of \\nthe world for the period 2016-2023. \\nThe results of calculating the level of cybercrime in 2016-2023 proved its gradual growth in the world. \\nThus, the rate of growth of the level of cybercrime in individual countries of the world during the analyzed \\nperiod exceeds 50% (Malta, Slovenia, Iceland, Moldova, Slovakia).

Using the single linkage method and Kohonen's self -\\norganizing maps, three clusters of countries were identified depending on the values of the indicators \\ncharacterizing the level of cybercrime in the country: the National Cyber Security Index, ICT Development \\nIndex, Global Cybersecurity Index, Global Terrorism Index, Crime Index. In addition, the comparative \\nanalysis of the clusters for the values of the indicators in 2023 and 2016 showed significant changes in their \\nstructure and size. Thus, the expansion of the third cluster indicates negative trends in the development of \\ncybercriminal activity.  \\nThus, the established dependencies confirm the conclusions of previous studies about a significant \\nincrease in the level of cybercriminal activity and the low efficiency of the existing mechanisms for \\nimproving cyber security in most countries of the world (Aliane et al, 2023; Kliestik et al, 2023; Kuzior et \\nal, 2022b). The obtained results serve as the basis for revising the existing toolki t for fighting crime in \\ncyberspace and using best practices (according to the results of clustering of countries) in combating crime \\nin the conditions of rapid development of digital technologies. \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \\nThis research was funded by the projects “M odeling the mechanisms of combating organized and transnational \\ncybercrime in war and post-war periods” (0124U000550), funding – Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine. \\nREFERENCES \\nAden Dirir, S.

The \\ngreatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best computer chess programs are now \\ncapable of beating humans. Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are \\nproving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing. \\nThere are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost \\nexclusively for AI applications. The two most common are LISP and Prolog. Artificial intelligence is working \\na lot in decreasing human effort but with less growth. \\n \\nKeywords: Data mining, Epistemology, Ontology, Heuristics, optimization \\nIntroduction \\nArtificial intelligence is defined as developing \\n \\nWormhole (AKA the Einstein -Rosen Bridge) is a             \\ntheoretical concept and a solution to Einstein’\\nfield equations of general relativity. Simply put, \\nwormholes are tunnels connecting two different \\nregions of space -time (Fig 2) (Darling, n.d.). \\nAlthough scientists are still unaware about the \\nimplications of the infinite curvature of spacetime in \\na black hole, they seem to be able to provide the \\nimmense forces of gravity required to curve space -\\ntime into a tunnel, thereby making wormholes a \\nplausible theory, but not one that is practical. Due to \\nthe infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a \\nwormhole wou ld collapse the moment it forms by \\nsinking into the black hole. Furthermore, to stabilize \\na wormhole, a substance known as “exotic matter” \\ni.e., matter with a negative mass, energy and density, \\nis required. Although this substance exists \\nmathematically, it  hasn’t been detected in the \\nobservable universe (Tillman et al, 2022). However, \\ncounter arguments have come forward in light of \\nnew research suggesting that if there is a quantum \\nconnection (Fig 3) between two black holes, “exotic \\nmatter” may not be required to stabilize the tunnel. If \\nsuch wormholes indeed do exist in black holes, then \\nquantum information entering the black hole will be \\nable to travel through the wormhole into another part \\nof the universe, thereby solving the paradox of loss \\nof informatio n in a black hole (Wolchover, 2017). \\nHowever, as none of this research has empirical \\nevidence, no definitive claims can be made. As the \\nname suggests , white holes are fundamentall \\nopposite to black holes. While it is impossible to \\nescape from a black hole,  it would be impossible to \\nenter a white hole (Xiao, n.d.). Both white holes and \\nblack holes look similar in nature when observed \\nfrom space, however, the brief expulsion of matter is \\nwhat differentiates the two. Viewing a white hole \\nwould almost be like a  “time reversal” of viewing a \\nblack hole (Wood, 2022). However, white holes at \\nbest can be called an impossible possibility, mainly \\nbecause of two reasons. Firstly, for the existence of a \\nwhite hole on the other side of a black hole, a \\nwormhole would be required to exist inside the black \\nhole joining two regions of spacetime (Fig 4). As \\nseen above, it is highly unlikely for such a theory to \\nbe true. Secondly, white holes fail to obey the second \\nlaw of thermodynamics –entropy (a measure of how \\nmany different states particles in a system can be in) \\nin the universe can either remain the same or it can \\nincrease; however.  computer programs to solve \\ncomplex problems by applications of processes that \\nare analogo\\nAccording to the current mining situation and the bottoming scheme, it is preliminarily determined'),\n",

Therefore, according to the \\nobtained final mining range at the level of -434 m \\nis measured, and it is finally determined that the \\nrange of parallel ore body strike of 850 m and \\nvertical ore body strike of 350 m is the hydraulic \\nfracturing construction area. \\nMaternal health is the health care service of \\nwomen during pregnancy, childbirth, up to the \\npostpartum period. These services are provided \\nwith an intention to reduce maternal morbidity \\nand mortality ( 1, 2). ‘WHO indicates that \\nmaternal health should help the mother to fulfill \\nnatural experience that is emotional to the mother \\nand reduce potential challenges where they suffer \\nhealth-wise and sometimes even death’. Prior to \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, maternal health was \\nalready affected by increased maternal mortality \\nand morbidity attributed to decreased so cial-\\neconomic status, cultural values and geographical \\nremoteness. These factors increase the risk for \\npregnancy-related illnesses, negative \\nconsequences after birth and maternal death more \\nin developing countries than in developed \\ncountries. Recently, the  COVID-19 pandemic is \\nfeared to have negative impact on maternal health \\n(3-5). Despite s ex-disaggregated data on SARS -\\nCoV2 mortalities suggesting more severe health \\noutcomes for men than women, there are concerns \\nthat the disease could disproportionately burden \\nwomen in a social and economic sense  (4, 6). \\nTherefore, it is a particularly significant question \\nwhether pregnant women are more susceptible to \\nSARS-CoV-2 or might develop severe disease \\noutcomes or suffer SARS -CoV2 associated \\nconsequences consider ing the impact of the \\npandemic and pandemic -control policies.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 5: Level-Propagation Radius line chart \\n \\nQuality Appraisal \\nStudies were appraised for quality using critical \\nappraisal tools (CADIMA) for systematic reviews \\ndeveloped by the University of Adelaide, South \\nAustralia.

It is \\ndifficult to make a machine like humans which \\ncan show emotions or think like humans in \\ndifferent circumstances. \\nNow we have accepted that artificial intelligence \\nis the study of how to make things which can \\nexactly work like humans do. It is the way in \\nwhich we think sensibly, act wisely, think like \\nhumans, work like humans. W har am kh or e \\nknow that through artificial intelligence, even \\ncomputer has defeated human in chess. So we can \\nsay that reaching so far has not gone waste, \\nsomehow, it is contributing towards the \\nadvancement in the Artificial intelligence. \\nAt present, there is no computer showing full'),\n",

This article provides an overview of the global \\nstate of IoT -based smart agriculture today, with a focus \\non how control activities and powering the entire \\ncultivation and irrigation process are carried out. We also \\nlooked at the various tools and technology employed in \\nIoT-based smart agriculture and their potential to \\nadvance Bangladesh's agricultural industry. More than \\n70% of the country's land is used for agricultural \\nproduction. Bangladesh is regarded as a nation \\nparticularly vulnerable to climate change, with its \\nagricultural sector frequently being devastated by \\nnatural calamities. IoT -based smart agriculture has the \\npotential to drastically alter Bangladesh's agricultural \\nindustry by lowering risks, increasing productivity, and \\nboosting resistance to climate change. The bulk of people \\nworking in the agricultural industry should raise their \\nlevel of life by embracing the era of Internet of Things \\n(IoT)-based smart agriculture.

Human -intensive agricultural practices \\nresult in more labor, higher production costs, and waste of \\nvaluable resources including water, electricity, and fertilizer \\n(Madushanki et al., 2019) . That is why, adoption of technology in \\nthe field of agriculture in a country like Bangladesh is essential for \\nhaving increased yield and to lessen the human labor as well as to \\nreduce waste, resulting in sustainable development of smart \\nfarming and food security (Kuddus et al., 2020). \\nTherefore, implementing technologies like AI, IoT, wireless \\nnetworks along with accountable leadership in Bangladesh's \\nagriculture industry can enhance smart farming efficacy and \\nefficiency (Haque et al., 2021) . From the beginning of history, \\nfarms relied on seasonal labor to boost profitability. But now, \\nconcepts like Agri-Food 4.0 are aiming to achieve reduced human \\neffort and greater yield. Agri -Food 4.0 is a digitalized method to \\nimprove productivity and land management, promoting \\nagricultural sustainability, farmer well- being, and sector \\ncompetitiveness with the help of 5G wireless communication \\ntechnology to the field (Panetto et al., 2020). \\nThe needs described above can be addressed by making effective \\nuse of IoT design concepts and technology assistance, resulting in \\na highly distributed communication network with optimum \\nresource consumption (Xia et al., 2012) . The Internet of Things \\n(IoT) is a fast growing mechanism that includes a wide range of \\nnetworked cloud applications, including as electrical, digital, \\nmechanical, and unique ID systems, allowing data to be \\ntransmitted without the need for human contact. IoT sensors and \\nbig data analytics can revolutionize farming techniques, resulting \\nin cost-effective and resource -efficient production. The goal is to \\nincrease yields, minimize water use, and transform traditional \\nagriculture to smart and precision agriculture by leveraging \\nautomation and IoT technologies (Abu et al., 2022; Alam et al., \\n2023; Ferdous et al., 2023 ). Nevertheless, it can also play a crucial \\nrole in implementing Smart Bangladesh by 2041, an initiative \\ntaken by the government of Bangladesh. \\n \\n2. Motivation: Needs of IoT based Agriculture in Bangladesh \\nFarmers and agriculture have a crucial role in ensuring food \\nsecurity and reducing poverty, contributing to Bangladesh's \\neconomic growth (Eastwood et al., 2019) . According to scholars, \\ntraditional farming remains prevalent in distant villages in \\nBangladesh, making achieving the United Nations' 2030 \\nSustainable Development Goal (SDG: 2.4.1) for sustainable \\nagriculture problematic (Abu et al., 2022). Several authors \\nproposed the use of IoT for smart farming (Ahmed et al., 2018) . \\nThough AI and IoT -based smart farming poses challenges for \\nalignment with traditional agriculture, there are scopes where \\nthese technologies can be applied to obtain sustainability in the \\nfield of agriculture in Bangladesh. The needs can be described as \\nsuch: \\n1. Managing Effective Energy with Low Energy Intensity \\n2. Managing irrigation \\n3. Managing fertilizer \\n4. Controlling pests detecting diseases \\n5. Precision Agriculture (PA) \\n \\nEnergy intensity is a criterion used to assess a country's economic \\nefficiency (Khosruzzaman et al., 2010). The lower the intensity, the \\nbetter the performance. Despite its low energy requirements, \\nBangladesh faces challenges in achieving sustainable growth \\nthrough efficient energy consumption (Philibert et al., 2002) . \\nIrrigation system consumes the most energy when it comes to \\nagriculture. In Bangladesh, most irrigation setups rely on diesel or \\nelectricity-powered pumps to draw subsurface water for irrigation, \\nwith just 30% of the water efficiently used by crops and the \\nremainder squandered (Mondal, 2010) . Using IoT devices and \\nsensors can ensure the proper use of water in the field for various \\ntypes of crops differently. Alongside, maintaining soil quality and \\nminerals is crucial for improving agricultural production (Sultana \\net al., 2014) . As different types of crops need different soil \\nconditions, IoT sensors can be calibrated and implemented to \\nensure optimal conditions for a variety of crops. Nevertheless, \\nproper use of fertilizers is crucial for desired plant growth. In \\nBangladesh, the usage of inorganic fertilizers such as urea, TSP, \\nand MoP since the 1950’s has resulted in nutrient imbalance, \\naffecting 75% of soil -plant systems due to adverse effects (Sultana \\net al., 2014)  and IoT devices can help to indicate the sufficient \\nusage of fertilizers which will be sustainable both in terms of cost \\nand environment. Also, managing pests and diseases of the corps \\nleads to better yield. A wireless sensor network -connected imaging \\nequipment may take high- resolution crop field photographs and \\nsend them to a central cloud server for AI analysis to detect plant \\nconditions and provide treatments (Patil et al., 2012). Moreover, \\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is a promising breakthrough in smart \\nagricultural systems that aims to optimize and improve procedures \\nwithin agricultural segments to promote long- term growth in \\noutput, management, and monitoring (Tzounis et al., 2017) . The \\nPA platform utilizes modern technologies, including NB -IoT, \\nremote sensing, communication protocols, mobile network \\ninfrastructure, and AI/ML, to meet the requirements (Patil et al., \\n2012).   \\nAccording to the Global ICT Standardization Forum for India, the \\npotential benefits of IOT include improved performance, visibility, \\nand scalability, better and more cost -effective services, \\ntransparency of physical flows and status information, and \\nincreased efficiency, accuracy, mobility, and automation (Patil et\"),\n",

To ensure sustainable development of Bangladesh in the \\nlong run, these benefits must be put to use in the field of \\nAgriculture.  \\n \\n3. Related Works \\nAdoption of IoT in agriculture is not yet widely popular in \\nBangladesh where most of the farmers still depend on traditional \\nmethods for production. However, there are several IoT solutions \\navailable currently which are utilized in agriculture for \\npesticide/fertilizer management, plant health, disease prevention, \\nirrigation monitoring, soil conservation, distribution network \\ntraceability, vehicle control, and machine and equipment \\nmaintenance (Abu et al., 2022). It's important to note that the \\nstrategies given in the studied publications for IoT systems can be \\nused in various scenarios. \\nCurrently, a trend of ongoing research and developments has been \\nobserved in this field. For instance, IoT devices are being used to \\nenhance agricultural water consumption by detecting soil \\nmoisture, monitoring irrigation sources, and incorporating \\nmeteorological and humidity data (Fernández -Ahumada et al., \\n2019). IoT disease control systems detect and prevent plant \\ndisorders by gathering environmental data such as photos, noises, \\ntemperature, and humidity and evaluating it with image \\nprocessing and artificial intelligence (Gayathri Devi et al., 2019) . \\nMoreover, IoT technology effectively identifies crop zones that \\nrequire fertilizer or pesticide treatment, whereas aerial photos \\nmeasure nitrogen concentration in huge plantations, potentially \\npinpointing individual fertilizer -required fields (Cao et al., 2018) . \\nIoT soil science platforms calculate planting parameters, assess \\nwater usage patterns, identify soil nutrients, and function as \\nweather stations for measuring air quality (Backman et al., 2019) . \\nAnother system (Prathibha et al., 2017)  intends to leverage IoT in \\nagriculture to detect environmental elements like temperature and \\nhumidity. For integrated IoT development, temperature and \\nhumidity sensors are used, together with a CC3200 processor. If \\nthe sensor detects abnormal readings, it sends information to \\nfarmers, who can then take appropriate action. An author offers a \\nnew IoT -based stick with temperature and moisture sensors that \\nprovides real-time data to farmers via a handheld device which is \\npowered by a solar panel and battery, transmits live data to the \\ncloud and shares it with experts remotely and provides an \\nefficiency of 99% (Nayyar & Puri, 2017) . With the references \\ngiven, it is high time that Bangladesh adopted these technologies \\nto increase the chances of high food security for the future. \\n \\n4. Methodologies \\nBy using IoT -enabled sensors on the farm, farmers can measure \\nsoil moisture levels, temperature changes, nutrient availability, pH \\nlevels, and more. This information can then be used to make \\ninformed decisions about when to irrigate or fertilize fields for \\noptimal growth. This is entirely a review article and, therefore, \\nrelies on secondary sources of information. The review draws \\nfrom various published reports and articles sourced from books, \\njournals, proceedings, and online platforms. Through the \\nsynthesis and analysis of these sources, this review aims to present \\na comprehensive overview of the topic and identify key findings, \\ntrends, and gaps and how to implement them in our country \\neffectively in the current knowledge base. When gathering data on \\nIoT Based Smart Agriculture in Bangladesh from different sources, \\nthese are the websites that should be highlighted in particular like \\nGoogle Scholar https://scholar.google.com/\\n, ResearchGate \\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/, Google www.google.com, BioOne \\nhttps://bioone.org/, GetCITED http://www.getcited.org/ , \\nAcademia https://www.academia.edu/. At the same time, \\ninquiring some other search engines like goggle and others for \\ngathering local information regarding IoT Based Smart \\nAgriculture in Bangladesh without facing any restriction in \\nconnection to year of publication. Owning to some limitation of \\nthe number of published studies, we included partial matches, \\nscientific reports, conference papers, reviews, unpublished reports, \\nopinion papers (no field-data), thesis and other publications in the \\ngrey literature. \\n \\n5. Architecture of IoT \\nThe best architectural choice for developing Internet of Things \\nsystems is layered architecture, sometimes known as n -tier \\narchitecture, in which n is the number of tyres/layers. This \\narchitecture distributes system components horizontally, with \\neach layer executing coherent functions without overlap and \\ncommunication limited to adjacent layers ( Syeed, et al., 2022). \\nThree layers make up the foundation of the Internet of Things: the \\nperception layer , which is used for sensing, the network layer, \\nwhich handles data transfer, and the  application layer , which is \\nused for data storage and manipulation (Villa -Henriksen et al., \\n2020).  \\n \\n \\n5.1 Perception Layer \\nThe perception layer includes terminal devices, sensors, WSN, \\nRFID, and NFC devices (Tzounis et al., 2017) . These devices and \\nsensors collect data on temperature, wind speed, humidity, \\nnutrient levels, plant diseases, and insect pests, processed by \\nembedded devices, and uploaded to a network layer for analysis. \\nThis layer is responsible for monitoring, control and \\ncommunication through Interface Core, Sensor Unit (Plug and \\nPlay), and Local Monitoring and Controlling applications (Syeed, et \\nal., 2022) . The Interface Core is the micro- kernel in a system, \\nproviding the necessary components for plug -in modules or\"),\n",

These modules are designed for specific \\nagricultural services like fertilization, paste control, environment \\nmonitoring, irrigation, and power management. They only \\nfunction when connected to the Interface Core and cannot be used \\nindependently. Web or mobile applications are used for local \\nmonitoring and controlling, allowing farmers to configure, \\ncontrol, and monitor the Sensor Units (Syeed, et al., 2022). \\n \\n5.2 Network Layer \\nIn this layer, Sensor nodes communicate with other nodes and \\ngateways to send data to a remote infrastructure for storage, \\nanalysis, processing, and transmission of important information \\n(Gubbi et al., 2013) . The Network Layer is the middle layer of this \\narchitecture, connecting the Perception and Application Layers. \\nIts architecture is impacted by the communication protocols used, \\nsuch as MQTT, which stresses performance, security, and \\ndependability. MQTT is a secure, lightweight, and energy -efficient \\ncommunication protocol, as per studies (Aziz, 2014). The MQTT \\nprotocol necessitates the use of a message broker and numerous \\nclients, with the Application Layer serving as the message broker \\nand the Perception Layer's Controller Unit as the MQTT client. \\nMQTT safeguards connections with transport layer security \\nencryption with a username and password. To address security \\nissues, a lightweight encryption technique is presented for \\nencrypting data in the perception layer prior to transmission to the \\nnetwork layer. This method provides quick, encrypted \\nauthentication, real-time communication, and no data loss ( Syeed, \\net al., 2022). Moreover, Wireless protocols and standards, such as \\nIEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee, Sigfox, ONE -NET, WirelessHART, \\nISA100.11a, LoRaWAN, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and \\nDASH7, facilitate interconnection between internet enabled \\ngateways and end-nodes (Suhohen et al., 2012).  \\n \\n5.3 Application Layer \\nThis is the final layer of the architecture where the benefits and \\nconveniences of IoT are most noticeable (Islam et al., 2022). This \\nlayer is typically a cloud server with high processing capabilities, \\nlarge storage unit, rich Input/Output subsystem, and extensive \\nPCI Express -based expansion capabilities, supporting large data \\nvolumes (Syeed, et al., 2022). There are several components of this \\nlayer which may include Database, Data Processing Engine, AI \\nEngine, Data Analytics Engine, API Engine etc. To elaborate, The \\nData Preprocessing Engine, which carries out operations including \\ndata cleansing, outlier detection, and inconsistency resolving, \\nprovides preprocessed data to the database. The AI Engine \\nfunctions as a central point for intelligent assistance systems, \\nproviding advanced artificial intelligence technology, such as \\nmachine learning algorithms and the Expert System, to enable \\ndecision support systems. The interface engine uses this \\nknowledge base to support reasoning, and the expert system stores \\ndomain information in a particular format. Modern web \\ndevelopment includes the Application Programming Interface \\n(API) to provide optimal results (Syeed, et al., 2022). \\n \\n6. IoT: Technologies and Devices \\nThe underlying technologies of IoT typically include wireless \\nconnectivity, sensors, embedded systems and cloud computing. \\nFor instance, Wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Cellular are some examples \\nof wireless connectivity used based on the range and power \\nrequirements. There are many sensors which can collect data like \\nTemperature, Humidity, Motion, Gas, Proximity etc from the \\nrespective environment. Moreover, embedded systems like \\nArduino, ESPs, Raspberry Pi, SoC (System -on-Chip) make the \\ncore of an IoT system. For cloud computing, platforms like \\nThinger.io, Microsoft Azure IoT, and Google Cloud IoT Core, \\nThingSpeak play a crucial role. Some of the commonly used \\ntechnologies in the field IoT namely, RFID technology, WSN \\ntechnology, Sensors technology, GPS technology are discussed in this \\nsection. \\n \\n6.1. RFID technology for IoT \\nRFID technology, also known as automated identification and \\ndata capture (AIDC), is considered by experts to be at the \\nfoundation of IoT (Wamba et al., 2008) . RFID (Radio Frequency \\nIdentification) technology utilizes electromagnetic fields to \\nautomatically detect and track tags attached to things. These tags \\ninclude electronically recorded data that may be read wirelessly \\nwith RFID scanners. RFID provides the seamless integration of \\nphysical things into digital systems in IoT applications, allowing \\nfor real-time asset visibility and control. \\nAn RFID system consists of RFID tags, RFID Readers, Middlewire, \\nand IoT platform. When an RFID tag gets within range of an RFID \\nreader, the device sends out radio waves. The RFID tag accepts \\nradio waves, powers up, and transmits its unique identity (ID) and \\nother data to the reader. The RFID scanner grabs the tag ID and \\nsends it to the middleware or straight to the IoT platform. The IoT \\nplatform processes the tag data, correlates it with other sensor data \\nas needed, and takes actions depending on established rules or \\nuser requests. There are four frequency bands now depending on \\nthe application: low frequency system at 125 kHz, high frequency \\nsystem at 13.56 MHz, ultra -high frequency system at 433 MHz or \\n868 MHz in Europe, and microwave RFID tags using the 2.4 GHz \\nor 5.8 GHz range (Brandl et al., 2016) . RFID enables real- time \\nasset tracking, more automation, higher data accuracy, better \\ninventory management, and easy interaction with current IoT \\ninfrastructure. \\n \\n6.2.

WSN's hardware architecture included four \\ncomponents: sensor, processor, transceiver, and power units  \\n(Warrier & Kumar, 2016). WSN combines MEMS (Micro electro \\nmechanical Systems), embedded computing, and wireless \\ncommunication to monitor and process network objects in real -\\ntime, providing detailed and accurate information (Ping Hua et al., \\n2018). \\nSensor nodes are low -power devices that collect environmental \\ndata and communicate with the network architecture via a \\ngateway or base station. These devices use a variety of \\ncommunication protocols, including Zigbee, Bluetooth Low \\nEnergy (BLE), IEEE 802.15.4, and LoRaWAN. Because of the \\nbattery's limited life, power management is critical. Sensor nodes \\ntransform physical environments or events into digital data while \\nperforming early processing to save energy. Data from many \\nnodes is pooled at intermediate nodes or gateways before being \\nsent to a central server or cloud platform. Aggregated data is \\nsaved, evaluated, and acted upon. WSN in IoT provides real -time \\nmonitoring, cost -effective deployment, wireless connectivity, \\nenergy efficiency, data insights etc. There is a wide range of \\napplications of these benefits of WSN technology which may \\ninclude monitoring of environment, healthcare, infrastructure as \\nwell as industrial automation and smart grid implementation.  \\n \\n6.3. Sensors technology for IoT \\nSensor technology, which includes sensitive components, \\nconversion elements, conversion circuits, and auxiliary power, has \\nbeen around for almost 150 years since the 1860s ( Ping Hua et al., \\n2018). Sensors are devices that detect and measure physical \\nqualities or environmental situations, then convert them to \\nelectrical impulses. These signals are subsequently processed, \\nevaluated, and used to make sound decisions in IoT applications. \\nSensors can be classified as physical, chemical, or biosensors based \\non their basic effects (Ma & YB, 2017) . Some examples of sensors \\ncan be made as: \\n \\nTemperature Sensors:  Measure the ambient temperature and \\nprovide data for climate control, weather monitoring, HVAC \\nsystems, and industrial applications. \\nHumidity Sensors: Air relative humidity levels are monitored for \\na variety of applications, including environmental monitoring, \\nHVAC control, and agricultural applications. \\nPressure Sensors:  Measure pressure fluctuations in gasses or \\nliquids for applications such as industrial automation, automotive \\nsystems, weather forecasting, and healthcare monitoring. \\nProximity sensors: Detect the presence or absence of surrounding \\nitems without physical contact, which is widely utilized in \\nindustrial automation, object detection, and security applications.  \\nMotion sensors:  Detect the movement of objects or people and \\nare used in security systems, lighting controls, occupancy \\nmonitoring, and gaming gadgets. \\nLight sensors:  Measure ambient light levels or detect changes in \\nlight intensity; they are used in smart lighting systems, automatic \\nstreet lights, and energy-saving applications. \\nGas sensors:  Detect the presence of specific gasses in the \\nenvironment, which is critical for industrial safety, air quality \\nmonitoring, and environmental protection. \\nAcceleration Sensors (Accelerometers):  These devices measure \\nthe acceleration forces exerted on objects along one or more axes \\nand are widely employed in inertial navigation systems, motion \\ndetection, and vibration monitoring. \\nInfrared Sensors:  Detect infrared radiation generated by objects \\nto determine temperature, proximity, or motion, commonly used \\nin temperature measurement, motion detection, and presence \\nsensing applications. \\n \\nSome important features of sensor technology that should be \\nconsidered while using one are accuracy, precision, range, \\nsensitivity, power consumption, interoperability. Sensor data from \\nIoT devi processed locally before being transferred to a central hub \\nor cloud platform for analysis and decision -making. This data is \\nused in fields like smart cities, industrial automation, healthcare, \\nand environmental monitoring. Moreover, In recent years, it has \\nbeen widely employed in agricultural processing and detection, \\ngreenhouse environment monitoring, fruit and vegetable \\npreservation, precision farming, and grain storage (Li et al., 2018). \\n \\n6.4. GPS technology for IoT \\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) technology is now an essential \\ncomponent of the Internet of Things (IoT), providing precise \\nlocation data that improves the usefulness and value of many IoT \\napplications. The GPS system consists of three components: the \\nspace satellite constellation, the ground control system, and user \\ndevices (Hofmann-Wellenhof et al., 2001) . It is a satellite -based \\ntechnology that determines a device's location and time. IoT \\ndevices with GPS receivers collect signals from numerous satellites \\nand compute their distance over time. They then engage in \\ntrilateration, in which they cross spheres formed by the distances \\nbetween each satellite. This triangulation pinpoints the device's \\nexact location. GPS-derived position data is integrated into an IoT \\nsystem and frequently sent to a central server or cloud platform for \\nreal-time tracking and analysis. GPS is a global system that \\nprovides 98% satellite coverage, allowing for continuous \\nobservation and measurement of at least four satellites at each\"),\n",

GPS -enabled IoT devices are critical for emergency \\nresponse and monitoring the elderly or patients with special \\nmedical needs. In the perception layer of IoT technology, GPS is a \\nrapidly expanding business with applications in traffic, navigation, \\nagriculture, environment monitoring, industrial, and healthcare \\n(Caldas et al., 2015). \\n \\n7. Potential of IoT in Agriculture \\nBangladesh's agricultural sector, contributing 14.79% to the \\ncountry's GDP and accommodating 45.1% of the labor force, is the \\nprimary livelihood source for rural people (Bagchi et al., 2019) . \\nThat is why it is important to implement technologies like IoT and \\nAI in agriculture to ensure sustainable development of this sector. \\nSmart agriculture, also known as precision agriculture, is the \\napplication of the Internet of Things in agriculture. It uses smart \\nirrigation systems, weather stations, farm management software, \\nlivestock wearables for health monitoring, autonomous machinery \\nand drones for precision farming, smart sensors to monitor soil \\nconditions, and farm management software for decision -making. \\nIt also promotes sustainable systems and boosts productivity. \\nTable-1 indicates how IoT can be significantly used in several steps \\nof agriculture. \\n \\n9. Challenges for the Future \\nAs we know, IoT systems are data driven architecture. It collects, \\nprocesses and analyses data, from the environment to the cloud \\nstorage. Artificial intelligence are systems that feed on data and \\ncan provide desired insight for the future similar condition. So \\nfurther research to integrate these two technologies for smart \\nfarming will be a sustainable step for the future. Moreover, \\nBangladesh is facing negative environmental and climate change \\nimpacts as a result of intensive cultivation practices, in addition to \\nits traditional farming culture. That is why it is important to \\nimplement these technologies while reducing or modifying \\ncurrent practices, in order to mitigate the adverse impacts of \\nclimate change with proper forecasting and precautions ( Syeed, et \\nal., 2022).  \\nAnother step towards sustainable agriculture can be the \\nimplementation of Precision Agriculture (PA). The approach \\noptimizes profitability, sustainability, and environmental \\nprotection by utilizing data from soils, crops, nutrients, moisture, \\nand yield. It involves observing, assessing, and responding to \\nvariations in agricultural production processes, using sensor \\ntechnologies for applications like yield monitoring, soil sensing, \\nand irrigation management (Lee et al., 2010) . So, further \\ndevelopment in this field can optimize cost and yield management \\nin agriculture which is beneficial for a country like Bangladesh \\nwhere overpopulation is a prominent problem. \\nFurthermore, to implement these technologies in agriculture of \\nBangladesh and to get actual benefits out of it, knowledge and \\nresponsible leadership can play a vital role. It is simultaneously an \\nopportunity and a challenge for the people of Bangladesh. \\nAccording to studies, responsible leadership originated as a \\nresponse to leadership failures caused by ethical and \\nsocioeconomic demands that had not been addressed in previous \\nliterature, notably in agricultural and sustainable development. \\nEffective leadership involves fostering inclusive connections with \\nstakeholders to achieve ethical, socially desirable, and sustainable \\noutcomes (Noor-E-Sabiha & Rahman, 2018) . So, with the \\ndevelopment of responsible leadership, Bangladesh is likely to see \\nrapid growth in this field. \\n \\n10. Conclusion \\nThis study concludes the basic principles of IoT and its \\nsignificance in the field of agriculture. Furthermore, it also \\nindicates how Bangladesh can adopt and implement this \\ntechnology to meet her current problems and to bring \\ndevelopment in the field of economy, food security and \\nmanagement, and socio -cultural aspects. As the global population \\ncontinues to rise and Bangladesh is at the forefront of the problem, \\nimplication of IoT in Agriculture, more specifically precision \\nagriculture (PA) can ease the need of excessive food demand while \\nfulfilling the SDG set by the United Nation. Because of the \\napplications of the IoT technology, broadly monitoring and \\ncontrolling, it is possible to to reach the desired end with the help \\nof adequate knowledge and leadership development. Development \\nand utilization of the underlying technologies like RFID, WSN, \\nSensors, GPS etc. can further help the agricultural growth in \\nBangladesh. As this technology is being adopted worldwide in the \\nfield of agriculture and agriculture holds a major role in the \\neconomy of Bangladesh, it is high time Bangladesh faced its \\nchallenges and made required arrangements to make sure it is \\nmoving towards the future with a sustainable approach. \\n \\nAuthor Contribution \\nA.R.S. and all authors wrote and reviewed the manuscript. \\n \\nAcknowledgment  \\nThe authors are grateful to their department.\"),\n",
